A Javascript virtual machine that I can put in my website.
It will pretty much just be used to run little programs which can be sent to the machine
via POST.

Also, due to that, the programs will have to be compiled down to readable characters, so I guess that will make it slightly
bigger but not too bad. I'll have to make a trade off between complexity of writing the compiler and virtual machine, and
the pain of writing programs for a minimalistic computer.
